    <h3>Positive Mind <span style="color:blue">Positive vibes</span> Positive Life</h3>
   <p>The outcome of life navigates either towards success or failure. Since the predictability of the outcome life is possible by original design as we have discovered. Therefore on this premise, the navigation of the outcome of life either towards success or failure is predictable. 
   </p>
   <p> 
    <strong> What this connotes is that success or failure in life is predictable.</strong><span style="color:blue;">The predictable outcome of life as either a success or failure is your responsibility.</span>  In other words, you are responsible for the level of success or failure you achieve in life. <span style="color:red;">It is not in the hands of external forces but rather it is up to you.</span>

  <h3>Wisdom and Maturity</h3>
<p>

  You are responsible for your life, and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make.” – Denis Waitley American motivational speaker, writer and consultant.
